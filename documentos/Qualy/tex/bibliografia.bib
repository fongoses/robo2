	robotic system designed to explore and map abandoned mines. A new
	set of software tools is presented, enabling robots to acquire maps
	of unprecedented size and accuracy. On 30 May 2003, the robot {"Groundhog"}
	successfully explored and mapped a main corridor of the abandoned
	Mathies mine near Courtney, Pennsylvania. This article also discusses
	some of the challenges that arise in the subterranean environments
	and some the difficulties of building truly autonomous robots.},
